Nov 8, 2016
	Yesterday : Figured out a plan for how to approach the Shape refactor.
	Today     : Decided on a framework that determines Shape behaviour from
				code within the Shape classes rather than anywhere else.
				It is dominated by the Drawable interface which is implemented
				by the PaintShape and branches out into filled Shapes and
				simple lines. Also created the ShapeFactory for more convenient
				and readable (self-documenting) shape creation.
	Obstacles : Previous system was fairly strongly based around a very poor model,
				it took a while to figure out a suitable replacement.

Nov 9, 2016
	Yesterday : Binge-coded an OO-based system for defining new Shapes.
	Today     : ShapeFactory and ShapeFactory / CompositePaintShapes tested to make
				sure they are functional (as well as rest of the shapes).
	Obstacles : Only time mostly, schedule was tight but this was solved via
				hard work and help of reliable team-mates.
Nov 12, 2016
	Yesterday :
	Today     : When the cursor is moved to a quadrant other than 4, shapes would glide
				across the screen and follow the cursor rather than expanding and filling
				area. This behaviour was resolved. In addition, the centre of a circle
				is now 'glued' to the origin of the click. Squares now respond properly
				to differences in X-delta and Y-delta from the origin to cursor.
	Obstacles : Some team-members misinterpreted the purpose of the update method in
				PaintShapes. This miscommunication was resolved.
Nov 14, 2016
	Yesterday :
	Today     : PaintShapes that were being in the process of drawn were always displayed
				behind all other shapes (I have resolved this). In addition, I focused on
				simplifying code where I could and introducing missing functionality where
				possible.
	Obstacles : None encountered today.

Nov 15, 2016
	Yesterday : Began work on the event-model and fleshed out the basic structure.
	Today     : The event-model is the greatest focus today, which means concluding documentation
				and implementing the framework across the entire project. The goal for today
				is to ensure that adding new functionality to the project is simple and that
				the model is sufficiently scalable for our purposes.
	Obstacles : None encountered today.

Nov 16, 2016
	Yesterday : Finished the event-model.
	Today     : Resolved issues with dotted-line, redo/undo, eraser now matches background tone
				even after a background color change. Fixed issue with triangle positioning.
				Drew a new image for every shape, the images are applied to the respective
				buttons. Documentation and resolving bugs has been a priority this day.
				Adjustments made to the hotkeys, as well as finishing touches complete
				for this sprint.
	Obstacles : None encountered today.
