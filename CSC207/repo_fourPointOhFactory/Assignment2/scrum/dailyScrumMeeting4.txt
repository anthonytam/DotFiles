	Yesterday :
	Today     : I updated my contact info and pushed to master branch.
	Obstacles : N/A

Nov 6, 2016
	Yesterday : I updated my contact info.
	Today     : I created 2 new branches, SquareClass and ScrumNensi. I created my Square class, finished its JavaDocs
				and pushed the class to the SquareClass branch. I didn't merge my branch yet, just in case I make changes
				to the class. ScrumNensi is the branch where I will push all my scrum daily meetings and merge
				master branch at the very end so that the members won't have to pull every time I write my scrum notes. 
	Obstacles : N/A
	
Nov 7, 2016
	Yesterday : Created an idea how all the classes work together.
	Today     : We planned the work, added user stories, set priorities and divided the work between members. Each member
				estimated the time it will take them for their user stories. I renamed my SquareClass branch
				UserStory8 (created new branch and merged them) since we had to use the UserStoryN format they gave us.
				Also merged UserStory8 with master and did some changes on the ShapeChooserPanel so that the 
				user sees what shape he has chosen to work on at the bottom.
	Obstacles : Had a merge conflict with Anthony, both editing the same file at the same time but we 
				resolved it. However, the class ShapeChooserPanel is not working how I intended to.
	
Nov 8, 2016
	Yesterday : I wrote all the user stories, divided the work amongst members and completed UserStory8. Made some changes
				in ShapeChooserPanel.
	Today     : Tried to fix the ShapeChooserPanel problem but we figured it was an architecture issue. We decided to use a 
				different design pattern (Factory) and today I planned all my work using the new pattern.
	Obstacles : Encountered difficulties understanding Factory design pattern.
	
Nov 9, 2016
	Yesterday : Planned the work using Factory design pattern.
	Today     : Worked on UserStory12 and 13. User is now able to draw a line. 
				Added a new menu button with features: fill color, stroke color and line thickness. Added functionality 
				to the color features. Now the user is able to pick colors for different shapes.
	Obstacles : The fillable shapes are only showing in one quadrant.

Nov 10, 2016

				product backlog will be part of Sprint 2.

Nov 12, 2016
	Yesterday : Read over the assignment.
	Today     : Added the new product backlog to the previous one. Added a new sprint in sprint backlog where I moved
				all the unfinished user stories from sprint 1, as well as the new user stories from the added product 
				backlog.
	Obstacles : N/A
	
Nov 13, 2016
	Yesterday : Updated the product backlog.
	Today     : Added a new eraser button and made it work. Needs improvement and also an image for the button.
	Obstacles : The eraser doesn't show while erasing. Can't see what is being erased during the process.
	 
Nov 14, 2016
	Yesterday : Added an unfinished eraser to the paint.
	Today     : Added a background color option on the features menu.
				Fixed eraser, now you can see what is being erased. Changed its color so that it erases with
				the color of the background instead of white. Also added an eraser image for its button in ShapeChooserPanel.
	Obstacles : Merge conflicts, unable to merge my Bug7 branch with master. Max and I were both working on the same files
				at the same time.
