Nov 5, 2016
	Yesterday : Group issues have been sorted out
	Today     : Cloned the repo and modified the members file to add contact info

Nov 6, 2016
	Yesterday : All repo issues have been sorted out and we are ready to start
	Today     : Added Java documentation too all parts of the starter code. Need to decide on a scrum master and
	            begin planning our user stories
	Obstacles : Deciding on a scrum master who would have time to ensure all duties are fulfilled
	
Nov 7, 2016
	Yesterday : Began to work on smaller tasks while waiting for the new framework to be created
	Today     : Focus on slightly larger tasks such as designing shape objects. Helped my group members to
	            better understand all the functions of git and an intro to basic terminal commands to help them
	            with the assignment
	Obstacles : The most user stories are based around the new framework. Once it has been created we will be able
	            to progress much faster
	
Nov 8, 2016
	Yesterday : Group members now better understand how to use git and terminal and are feeling more confident with
	            these tools
	Today     : Once the framework was complete, I gave the model and view an overhaul to better take advantage of
	            this framework. The MVC model of the program now works together much more fluently. Other user
	            stories have now been assigned and are being built.
	Obstacles : Slight issue with the drawing of circle. It either is not calculating the radius correctly or is
	            displaying around the correct points
	
Nov 9, 2016
	Yesterday : Completed most of the core user stories. Some small tasks are still required to be finished
	Today     : Complete the remainder of the user stories. Also fixed the bug where the circle was not displaying
                properly. The display function was not outputting the correct points.
	Obstacles : Had to overcome merge issues with other commits and better coordinate together which files were being
	            edited to prevent other conflicts.

	Yesterday : Break for the weekend
	Today     : Helped other group members fix small bugs with their features to clear out user stories. Organized
