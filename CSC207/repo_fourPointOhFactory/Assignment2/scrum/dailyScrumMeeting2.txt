				design of the assignment. 
				Also worked on UserStory8 which was simply adding the Square object in ShapeChooserPanel

				from bottom right to top left but not the other way around (top left to bottom right).

	Today     : Created the DottedLine feature. Organized how to implement this feature. Completed most of it by adding to Shape
				ChooserPanel, and created a new builder for DottedLine.

				Completed UserStoryDotted and merged with master. 
				Completed the documentation for the dotted Line class and other methods that I added for that UserStory.

	Today     : attempted to fix dotted Line but failed to do so. Started working on Triangle, completed most of it. 
				Started working on the bug for the triangle class
	Obstacles:  Got two conflicts with the Triangle User Story. The first obstacle was that I wasn't able to draw a second triangle 
				with the same first click. Whenever I would draw another triangle, the previous one would disappear.
				The second conflict was that the fill color for triangle does not work.
