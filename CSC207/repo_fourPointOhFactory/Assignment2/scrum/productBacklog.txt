ISSUE    : ANoteOnGit.txt members.txt scrum and other non-src files/folders

TYPE     : BUG 2.6
NAME     : Git repo has incorrect .gitignore
OWNER    : Anthony
PRIORITY : Low
ESTIMATE : 5 min
ISSUE    : Modifications to src files leads to changes to .class files
in repo_[GROUP]/Assignment2/bin/. These changes lead to, if commited,
potential conflicts. To fix this, on the master branch, add a .gitignore to
repo_[GROUP]/Assignment2/ or repo_[GROUP]/. The contents of .gitignore
could be, for example,

/bin/

You will need to add the .gitignore to index, commit and push it.
Unfortunately, this is not the end of the issue though, once git starts
tracking a file, it continues tracking it. To fix this, delete the .class
files (and any other files of interest) from the bin directory. Add this
change to index, commit and push.

TYPE     : BUG 2.1
NAME     : Architecture for drawing shapes can be improved
OWNER    : Max (Already Completed in pt 1)
PRIORITY : High
ESTIMATE : N/A
ISSUE    : The architecture can be improved if we implement the Command Design
Pattern to draw shapes as follows:

The PaintModel should use the command design pattern.
That is, each shape knows how to draw itself, so there is a single list of
DrawingCommands maintained by the PaintModel and used by the PaintPanel.
paintComponent simply asks the PaintModel to ask command to execute(g2d).
The simplest way to make this happen is to make each shape implement the
DrawingCommand interface which requires execute(g2d) to be implemented.
Well sort of.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 2.2
NAME     : Architecture for handling shape modifiers can be improved
OWNER    : Max (Already Completed in pt 1)
PRIORITY : High
ESTIMATE : N/A
ISSUE    : The architecture can be improved if we implement the Command Design
Pattern to handle changes to the graphics contex such as changing drawing
color, stroke width etc. You can accomplished this by wrapping the changes
to the graphics context in a DrawingCommand. This way these changes can be
added to the Bug 2.1 DrawingCommand list. That is, these new types of
DrawingCommands appear on PaintPanel's list right along side
the Shape type DrawingCommands.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 2.3
NAME     : Architecture behind choosing drawing mode is poor
OWNER    : Max (Already completed in pt 1)
PRIORITY : High
ESTIMATE : N/A
ISSUE    : A better architecture behind selecting a drawing mode can be created
by implementing the Factory Design Pattern as follows:

The factory design pattern should be used by the paint buttons.
The factory is responsible for creating different ShapeManipulatorStrategy
instances (see BUG 2.4). That is, when a button is pressed, the appropriate
ShapeManipulatorStrategy is created and installed in the PaintPanel.
Note that you can associate text with a button, even if you
display an ImageIcon. The string attached to the button causes the right choice
of object creation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 2.4
NAME     : Architecture behind creating shape instances is poor
OWNER    : Max (Already Completed in pt 1)
PRIORITY : High
ESTIMATE : N/A
ISSUE    : A better architecture for creating shape instances so that it is
more flexible, and easier to work with can be created using the Strategy Design
pattern as follows:

Create class/abstract class/interface  ShapeManipulatorStrategy as well
as subclasses/implementators for each type of Shape. Call these the
concrete ShapeNamipulatorStrategies

The concrete ShapeManipulatorStrategies are responsible for

1. Creating instances of Shape and putting them on top of
   the PaintModel command stack.

2. Understanding how mouse events modify the shape at the top of the
   PaintModel command stack.

3. Calling the PaintPanel repaint at appropriate times.

This strategy can be put in place either by having PaintPanel's mouse
events forwarded through PaintPanel into the current strategy, or by
simply switching the PaintPanel's listeners as appropriate.
