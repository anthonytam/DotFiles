				<h2>Lab 3 (Week 4) Advanced OO and Inheritance </h2>

<h3>Notes</h3>
		<ul>
		<li> Please login and work on the lab systems!!
		<li> Marks for the lab are for committing and pushing your work to the repo.
		<li> During the lab, if you know what you are doing, and can help your neighbour, then help them. If you need help, ask us or your neighbour.
		</ul>
		
		<h3>References</h3>
		Lecture notes can be found here (cloning these onto the lab computers may make you exceed quota; clone these on your own machine. 
		Or, clone them on lab computer, look at necessary files, then delete them and empty trash.):

		<h3>Setup and Submission</h3>

			<li>Launch Eclipse Neon (if you see a blank screen, close the blank tab)
			</li>
			
			<li>Switch to Git perspective (or Window &gt; Show View &gt; Other &gt; Git &gt; Git Repositories) to view a list
			of all your git repositories in your Eclipse sidebar.</li>
			<li>
			Right click on your repo_UTORID.git repo and select "Pull" (if you don't have this directory, follow instructions under the "Git" and "Making Eclipse aware of your repo" from the 
			<a href="http://axiom.utm.utoronto.ca/~207/16f/labs/02/">first lab</a>).</li>
			<li>File &gt; Import &gt; Git &gt; Projects from git</li>
			<li>Select "Existing local repository"</li>
			<li>Select repo_UTORID</li>
			<li>Select "Import existing Eclipse project" and from the dropdown, select LabWeek04 (<b>the <u>whole</u> directory; don't browse into it</b>). Select "Next", then "Finish"</li>
			<li>Now switch to Java Perspective and work with the files in the LabWeek04 project</li>
		<li>As you work on the lab, commit your changes as follows: Right-click LabWeek04, and select Team &gt; Add to Index (this is git add), then right-click again and select Team &gt; Commit.</li>
		<li>In the "Git Staging" window, enter appropriate commit message, and then click the "Commit and Push" button.</li>
	<strong><font color="red"><li>SUBMISSION: Remember to "Commit and Push" your project at the end of your lab so we can see the most updated version of your lab work.</li></font></strong>
		</ul>
	
			<h3>1. Complete PlayWithShapes.java</h3>

		<ul>
      		<li> Follow the instructions within the comments written in the file <code>PlayWithShapes.java</code> to complete this class.
      	</ul>
		<h3>2. Inheriting from an Abstract Class</h3>
		Take a look at the existing Rectangle and Circle classes. Create a Square class which inherits from <b>Rectangle</b>:
		<ul>
		<li>A Square is a Rectangle that has an (x, y) position, a color, and a width</li>
		<li>This class should just have two constructors as follows:
		<ul>
		<li>By default (without any given arguments), a Square is created as blue, with width 10, and position (100, 100)</li>
		<li>A Square can also be created with four arguments (String c, int width, int x, int y) that sets the color, width, and x,y values as the arguments given</li>
		<li> Nothing to submit, just think about, whether it really makes sense to make Square a subclass of Rectangle. For some
			help in thinking about this, take a look at this discussion of the <a href=http://stackoverflow.com/questions/56860/what-is-the-liskov-substitution-principle>Liskov Substitution Principle</a>.
		</ul>
		<!--<li>Play around to see if Square will need its own getters/setters. Does calling getWidth or getHeight on a Square already return the expected values? Why or why not?</li>
		<li>How about a toString? Does it need its own toString?</li>-->
		</ul>


      	<h3>3. Work through UnderstandingInheritance.java</h3>
<ul>
		<li> Write comments in the file to describes all the methods that are called as a result of each line. For example...
</ul><xmp>
Square s=new Square();
// The line above calls the Square() constructor
// which executes this("blue", 10, 100, 100); which calls
// the Square(String c, int width, int x, int y) constructor
// which executes super(c, width, width, x, y); which calls ...
// ... (complete this)
</xmp>
		</ul>
