Dec 3, 2016
	Yesterday : Vacation Day
	Today     : Look into file parsing, talk to group member about how to go about the solution. Will probably
	            implement a serial class which is able to decipher the save file code into an object and will
	            turn an object into save file code.
	Obstacles : Realized Part 2 Question 3 didn't need to be done with floating point numbers.

Dec 4, 2016
	Yesterday : Decided how the save and load features will be built. Decided I will be focusing on deserialization
	            inside of each Shape.
	Today     : Created a new constructor in each shape that will take a serial object and build the shape with
	            the given attributes. Each of these attributes are verified while being loaded into the object. If
	            there are any issues, a corresponding exception will be thrown. This exception will be used to lay out
	            the error message.
	Obstacles : Trying to avoid merge conflicts while working on our respective parts.
