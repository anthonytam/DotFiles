	Yesterday : Brainstormed serialization methods

	Obstacles : N/A

Dec 4, 2016
	Yesterday : Decided how to serialize each object. Will create central class
	Today     : Created the serial object which allows for listing generic typed attributes for an easy to parse class.

	            string object.
