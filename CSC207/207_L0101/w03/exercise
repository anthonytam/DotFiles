EXERCISE:

Create an abstract class for an Animal.

All Animals have a name, and a sound that 
they can make (e.g. "moo", "meow").

All Animals can makeNoise which prints 
out "[name] says [sound]".

All Animals should be able to walk.
(this will be an abstract method; different for
every animal)

-

Create a concrete (non-abstract) class called 
Cat which inherits from Animal.

public Cat(String name)

By default, cats make the sound "meow".

They have a cat-specific method called "purr" that 
prints out "[name] says purrrrr".

When a cat walks, it prints out 
"LOL. no. sleeping."
