Qualifications:

Data Analytic at Canada Post (2016)
   I never thought about working as a data analytic in the past, however a job opportunity arose and I decided it was an excellent opportunity
   to find out if it interested me. After spending 3 months at Canada Post, I had discovered a new and fascinating area of computer science. Initially,
   I spent my work days trying to find the root cause of an issue (IE. We have a 30% late delivery rate for company X, why?) however this quickly 
   progressed to finding issues yet to be discovered. My coworker and I created macros for Microsoft Excel and Access to mine through millions of
   package scans, generating statistics and a root cause analysis for every failing package. Our macros are still being used day to day after our
   departure to uncover new failures in the mail flow.

DeerHunt (2017)
   As the Server Administrator of the UTM MCSS, I played a crucial role in the development of the auto marking server used for code submissions. 
   When users submit their code, the server would attempt to compile and run the code. In the event of any compiler or runtime errors, the system
   is able to parse the error for a more generalized message (Part of the challenge was the server wouldn't tell you the exact error your receiving,
   this way test cases were never revealed) and display it to the user.
