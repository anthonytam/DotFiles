* Week 2
** Labs
   Look at summary of TODO's
** Circuits
   Generally, and before or unless otherwise specified (breackets)
*** Creating complex logic
   Create truth table of the desire behaviour
   Come up with a good boolean expression with the truth table
   Covert the boolean extression to gates
   
   Key point is creating a good boolean expression
** Minterms and Maxterms
   Sort the rolls accorinng to the values to ABC
   The for each row, name the inputs as m_{\{Row_Number\}}

   The minterm: an AND expression with every input represented in true or complemented form
      Looking for 1 output
   The maxterm: an OR expression with every input respresented in true or complemented form
      Looking for 0 output
*** Examples
    Lets have a circuit with 4 inputs: A B C D

    | Circuit                                     | Max or Min term            |
    |---------------------------------------------+----------------------------|
    | A\dot B\dot C                               | Neither (missing input)    |
    | A+B+C                                       | Neither (missing input)    |
    | A\dot B + C\dot D                           | Neither (mixes and and or) |
    | A+B(Complement)+C+D(Complement              | Maxterm, M_5               |
    | A\dot B(Complement)\dot C\dot D(Complement) | Minterm, m_10              |
    
** Notation
   AND can be rep with \dot or * or ^
   OR can be rep with + or v
   NOT can be rep with (102 sym) or A' or A(Complement)
   XOR is plus with circle

** Going from Truth Table to Expression
   A single minterm indiates with inputs and will make the output go high
