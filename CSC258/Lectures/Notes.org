* Week 2
** Labs
   Look at summary of TODO's
** Circuits
   Generally, and before or unless otherwise specified (breackets)
*** Creating complex logic
   Create truth table of the desire behaviour
   Come up with a good boolean expression with the truth table
   Covert the boolean extression to gates
   
   Key point is creating a good boolean expression
** Minterms and Maxterms
   Sort the rolls accorinng to the values to ABC
   The for each row, name the inputs as m_{\{Row_Number\}}

   The minterm: an AND expression with every input represented in true or complemented form
      Looking for 1 output
   The maxterm: an OR expression with every input respresented in true or complemented form
      Looking for 0 output
*** Examples
    Lets have a circuit with 4 inputs: A B C D

    | Circuit                            | Max or Min term            |
    |------------------------------------+----------------------------|
    | A\cdot B\cdot C                            | Neither (missing input)    |
    | A+B+C                              | Neither (missing input)    |
    | A\cdot B + C\cdot D                        | Neither (mixes AND and OR) |
    | A+B(Complement)+C+D(Complement     | Maxterm, M_5                |
    | A\cdot B(Complement)\cdot C\cdot D(Complement) | Minterm, m_10               |
    
** Notation
   AND can be rep with \dot or * or ^
   OR can be rep with + or v
   NOT can be rep with (102 sym) or A' or A(Complement)
   XOR is plus with circle

** Going from Truth Table to Expression
   A single minterm indiates with inputs and will make the output go high
   We can use AND or OR on mintables to explain more complecated expressions
   Sum on minterms - Find a single high
     Known as a Sum-of-Products
   Product of Maxterms - Find a single low
     Known as Product of Sums
   These are interchangebale, however look at if you require more high or low values

   We can simplity statements if they differn by a single point

*** KMap
    Min terms in 1 retangle can ve reduced into 1 term
