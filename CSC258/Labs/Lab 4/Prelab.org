* SR Latch Truth Table

| C | S | R | Q | Q' |
|---+---+---+---+----|
| 0 | X | X | X | X  |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | X | X  |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1  |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0  |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0  |

Notes:
 - The clock does not play a major role in the truth table
   - When the clock is 0, we are always in a latch state and retain the previous value (Denoted by X)
