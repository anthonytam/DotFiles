* Question Two
** Part a
   - The sequence with the largest possible total cost is $n - 1$ insert
     statements followed by a single cut statement. This will cause the
     worst possible cost to be $2(n - 1)$ or $2n - 2$.
   - This means the upper bound of the cost will be:\\\\
     #+Begin_Latex
     $= \frac{2n - 2}{n}$\\
     $= 2 - \frac{2}{n}$
     #+End_Latex
** Part b
   - Each inserted element should be charged $2.75 This will leave enough
     money for an insert to occur at $0 and collect enough money to allow
     for a cut operation. When an element is inserted, it has a carry over
     of $1.75. If n elements are inserted, there is a carry over of $n\cdot{}1.75.
     This added cost allows for n elements to be inserted, and cut can be 
     called until k is equal to 0 without running out of money. When calling
     cut untill k = 0, there will either be a remainder of 0\le{}X\le{}1.75
