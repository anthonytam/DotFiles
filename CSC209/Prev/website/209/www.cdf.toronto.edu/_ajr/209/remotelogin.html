<h1>Remote login to UTM linux</h1>

You can log in to your UTM linux account and work from elsewhere at UTM,
and if you have internet access at home, you can log in to your UTM linux
account and work from home.

<p>
(Note, however, that attendance is taken in the tutorials -- you need to
attend the tutorial (physically) to receive credit for the tutorial exercise.)

<p>
There is a remote login protocol called "ssh" which is supported by the
UTM linux computers.
That is, the UTM linux computers
run the "server"; what you need for home is the "client" software, which is
the other side of a "server-client" connection over the internet.
(Similarly, your web browser is a "client" and it connects to a "web server"
over the internet.)

<p>
The computer to log in to is "cslinux.utm.utoronto.ca".

<p>
Possible client software (all freely distributable) is:
<ul>
<li> For unix/linux,
<a href="http://www.openssh.com/portable.html">OpenSSH</a>.
Probably included with your modern OS
distribution; try typing "ssh&nbsp;user@cslinux.utm.utoronto.ca"
at a shell prompt.
<li> For Mac OS X, also openssh.  Use a terminal window (in Utilities under
Applications).
<li> For MS-Windows,
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>.
</ul>

<p>
You should try to run applications such as web browsers on the machine
you are physically at; e.g. start firefox <i>before</i> doing a network
login to a(nother) linux host (or make sure that when you start it later,
you are running it on the local machine, not on the remote machine).

<p>
I strongly recommend doing your work on the UTM linux computers.
Using ssh, you can do this from home.

<p>
On the other hand, you may be able to work on your programs using a C compiler
at home.
Some of the issues here are:
<ul>
<li> If your own computer ceases functioning for any reason, this won't be
accepted as a legitimate excuse for lateness.
The UTM linux machines are provided for you to do your course work on and they are
properly maintained, by professional sysadmins.
<li> I will likely not be able to help you with any technical problems with
your own equipment (although my students are welcome to ask me for help
and I'll see if I have any relevant advice).
<li> To test and submit your programs, they have to be in your directory on
the UTM linux
computers.  So you will have to transfer them, and some people introduce
problems with their files when they do this.  In particular, you will likely
have to make sure that they are transferred in "text mode" so as to avoid
interesting control characters cropping up at the ends of the lines.
Other problems people experience relate to non-standard character codes used
by macintoshes and especially ms-windows, notably for the directional quotes and
em-dash.
<li> Your programs have to compile and run on the UTM linux computers.
If you are using a C compiler at home, well, C compilers vary substantially in
quality and in the extent to which they correctly implement the C programming
language.  Furthermore, a lot of C compilers these days allow "C++isms" of
various kinds, especially if those compilers are just restricted versions of
C++ compilers from the same vendor, and you must write your
assignments for this course in C, not C++.
So it will be essential to make sure your programs function correctly on the
UTM linux
computers, after you transfer them from home.
<li> Some of the programs in CSC 209 will be unix-specific, and won't work on
a non-unix (and non-linux) system which you may have at home.
(This is not a problem if you are running linux or unix at home.)
</ul>

<p>
So all of the above is to say that I recommend simply logging in to UTM linux and
always working on UTM linux even if you are not physically in DH 2020 or 2026.

<p>
But if you don't do that, you might need to copy files between your home
computer and UTM linux.
To copy files to and from UTM, I recommend:
<ul>
<li> for unix/linux, openssh (or any other version of ssh) has "scp" and "sftp".
I use scp, and also often "rsync -e ssh".
<li> For Mac OS X, a nice GUI-clicky sftp client is
<a href="http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/fugu/">"Fugu"</a>
(and of course you can still use scp and sftp).
<li> for MS-Windows, PuTTY comes with
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">"pscp"
from the same site</a>.
For a graphical-user-interface scp client, try
<a href="http://winscp.net/eng/download.php">"WinSCP"</a>.
(In either case, check the newlines on the resulting file!)
</ul>
