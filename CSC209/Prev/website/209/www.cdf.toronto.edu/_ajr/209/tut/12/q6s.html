<b>1.</b> [15 marks]
What is the output (on stdout) from the following commands?
If you can't tell from the information given, state what additional
information you would need.

<p><b>General solutions note:</b>
If you don't understand the supplied answer,
now that you're no longer in the exam situation,
please actually try the command,
and experiment from there.

<p>
a)   <tt>test x = x</tt>

<p><b>Answer:</b>
no output to stdout

<p>
b)   <tt>expr 2 + 3 | wc -l</tt>

<p><b>Answer:</b>
<tt>1</tt>

<p>
c)   <tt>echo hi | wc -c</tt>

<p><b>Answer:</b>
<tt>3</tt>

<p>
d)   <tt>(echo hi; echo bye) | sort</tt>

<p><b>Answer:</b>
<br>
<tt>bye</tt>
<br>
<tt>hi</tt>

<p>
e)   <tt>echo hi; echo bye | wc -l</tt>

<p><b>Answer:</b>
<br>
<tt>hi</tt>
<br>
<tt>1</tt>

<p>
f)   <tt>expr 2 * 3</tt>

<p><b>Answer:</b>
It depends upon what files are in the current directory, because '*' is
substituted accordingly.
<br>
(E.g. if there is only one file and it is named '+', then this command line
will expand to "<tt>expr 2 + 3</tt>" and yield the output "5".)

<p><b>Grading:</b>
<br> Out of: 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3.
<br>
For part (f), just saying that you think the author meant
<tt> expr 2 \* 3 </tt> was worth one out of 3.  The question was what
<i>does</i> happen, and this is a much harder question.
