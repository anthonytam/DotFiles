<h1>CSC 209 tutorial 01 exercises, week of 11 January 2016</h1>

<blockquote>
<small>
After you've done these exercises, you can look at
<a href="soln.html">my solutions</a>.
</small>
</blockquote>

<p>
To play along with these instructions in the lab, you probably want to cd to
the directory <tt>/student/csc209/tut/01</tt>

<p>
You can find the terminal program under the menu "Applications", submenu
"System Tools".

<p>
<hr>
<p>

Please begin by running "/student/csc209/present".
This records your attendance and is required for you to get the marks for the
lab.

<p>
<hr>

<h3> Part 1 </h3>

<p>
Write a "glob" expression which matches all filenames in the current
directory with the following properties.  Do not worry about the issue of
filenames beginning with a dot.

<p>
(To test your expression, you could use "echo".  For example, "echo *" will
show you all of the file names in the current directory.)

<ol>
<li> filenames beginning with an 'a'
<li> filenames ending with a 'c'
<li> filenames containing at least one 'x', anywhere in the filename
<li> filenames containing one or more digits, anywhere in the file name
<li> filenames which end with a dot and then exactly three further characters
<li> filenames beginning with an uppercase letter (this has a
complication, discussed in the solutions file)

<li> In a directory containing the following five file names:
<pre>
	a.c   abcdef  b.c  b.x   bac
</pre>
, for a given triple below, write a glob expression which matches those three
file names and not the other two.
<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> One of these is impossible.  Identify which one is
impossible, and solve the others.

<ul>
<li> a.c, b.c, and b.x
<li> a.c, b.c, and bac
<li> b.c, b.x, and bac
<li> a.c, abcdef, and b.c
<li> a.c, abcdef, and b.x
</ul>

</ol>

<p>
Write a unix command to produce the requested output:

<ol>

<li> The number of lines in /etc/passwd.  (The file "/etc/passwd" lists
all user accounts on the system, one per line.)

<li> The count of how many users have an 'e' in their user information somewhere
(anywhere in their line in /etc/passwd).

<li> The contents of the file named:  <tt>&amp;@$%*</tt>

<li> The alphabetically-first three lines in the file "abcdef", in order
(i.e. the earliest alphabetically, then the second-earliest, then the
third-earliest).

<li> All lines in the output of the "dumbproverb" command, but with every 'e'
character translated to a '?'.
<br>
(You can find "dumbproverb" in /student/csc209/tut/01/dumbproverb)

<li> All file names in the current directory which contain a 'b'.

<li> The number of people who logged in at exactly 10:45.

<li> All lines of the file "abcdef" in the current directory which contain a
capital 'E'.

<li> The number of blocks used by the directory /usr/include, using "du".
But the output of "du /usr/include" has lines for each subdirectory and we only
want the last line, the one with the total.

<li> /student/csc209/tut/01/t2 is a text file listing integers, one per line.
Output the largest number in this file.

</ol>

What is the difference between the shell "glob notation" (file pattern
matching) expressions "*" and "*.*" (without the quotes)?
State a file name which one of them would match and the other would not match.


<p>
<hr>


<h3> Part 2: sed </h3>

Recall the "sed" filter, which implements a number of editor-like commands.
These questions will be about its 's' command -- search and replace.

<p>
We can change the first 'o' to 'x' in each line with:  sed s/o/x/
<br>
This can be followed by file names, or it can read from the standard input.
If the standard input is the terminal, we have to press ^D as the special
end-of-file-from-terminal signal; instead of doing that, in this question
we will use 'echo' and a pipe, like this:
<pre>
	echo Madonna Ciccone | sed s/o/x/
</pre>

<p>
1. That only translates the first 'o' on each line.  How do you translate them
all?

<p>
2. Why aren't quotes needed around "s/o/x/" above?

<p>
3. Write the 'sed' command which translates names of the form "Madonna
Ciccone" to "Ciccone, Madonna" as demonstrated in the first lecture.
<br>
Tools: regular expressions (the normal kind, not the "glob" notation);
and backslashed-parentheses in the search string matched with backslashed
digits in the replace string.
<br>
If you can't reproduce this, it's <a href=sed3s.html>here</a> (you'll need that to
go on).
<br>
Why are the quotes needed here but not in the earlier example?

<p>
4. Write a sed command which doubles the first 'x' on each line.
For example, "h@x0r" would become "h@xx0r".
Don't use quotes unless necessary.

<p>
5. Write a sed command which doubles the first digit on each line.
For example, "h@x0r" would become "h@x00r".
Don't use quotes unless necessary.


<p>
<hr>


<h3> Part 3: software tools principles (bonus) </h3>

You are writing a simple command "dechex" which converts decimal (base 10) to
hexadecimal (base 16, using letters 'a' through 'f' for the additional six
digits).

<p>
For example, "dechex 46" will output "2e".

<p>
Or should that be "0x2e"?  That's how you would write this as a hexadecimal
constant in C, Python, Java, or the majority of modern programming
languages.

<p>
In deciding between output like "2e" and output like "0x2e", you turn to the
software tools principles at
<a href="../../notes/tools.html#principles">https://cs.utm.utoronto.ca/~ajr/209/notes/tools.html#principles</a>

<p>
For bonus marks of about 10% of the tutorial value,
answer this question in a short text file, stating whether you include the
"0x" or not; which software tools principle your decision is in accordance
with; and how this helps your program be put together with other programs.
Your answer must be short and clear to receive the marks.


<p>
<hr>
<p>
<a href="soln.html">solutions to parts 1 and 2</a> (except for the last two items)


<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2> To submit </h2>

<p>
First of all, you must run "/student/csc209/present",
during the tutorial time, on the console of a tutorial lab workstation.

<p>
Then, by midnight at the end of your tutorial day, you must
submit solutions to part 2 (sed) exercises #4 and #5 (the
last two items), and optionally the part 3 question, as follows.

<p>
First, put the solutions in separate files named tut1a (question 4), tut1b
(question 5), and optionally tut1c (part 3).
You can test your part 2 solutions with commands such as
"<tt>echo h@x0r | sh tut1a</tt>"
and "<tt>echo xylophone | sh tut1a</tt>".

<p>
Make sure that your tut1c solution is a plain text file by typing "<tt>cat
tut1c</tt>".

<p>
Secondly, submit with the command
<pre>
	/student/csc209/submit tut1 tut1a tut1b tut1c
</pre>

<p>
Note in this command that the "tut1" is the "assignment" name you are
submitting under, and the "tut1a" and "tut1b" and "tut1c" are the files to submit.
You can submit them simultaneously as above, or at different times.
<br>
You may still change your files and resubmit them any
time up to the due time.
<br>
Example of submitting a single file (whether an initial submission or a
resubmission):
<pre>
	/student/csc209/submit tut1 tut1b
</pre>
As well, you can check that your files have been
submitted with the command
<pre>
	/student/csc209/submit -l tut1
</pre>
(that's minus 'l' for "list", not a 'one')

<p>
If there are any problems with this, during the tutorial contact your TA, or
after the tutorial e-mail ajr.  Problems running the 'submit' command will
not generally be accepted as a reason for lateness.

<h2> Important academic offence note! </h2>

Your work in this course which is submitted for course credit must be your
own.
Representing someone else's creative work as your own is an academic offence.

<p>
The tutorial (lab) work in this course is individual.  You can discuss the
items which are not for course credit with anyone, but the items which are
submitted for course credit must represent your own work.  It is also an
offence to assist others in committing an academic offence (e.g. by providing
your solution to them).

<p>
If you have questions about work to be submitted for course credit, ask a TA
or the instructor (perhaps by e-mail).

sheet</a>.
