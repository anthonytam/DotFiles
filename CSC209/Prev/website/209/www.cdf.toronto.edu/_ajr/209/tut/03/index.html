<h1>CSC 209 tutorial 03 exercises, week of 25 January 2016</h1>

<p>
<hr>
<p>

Please begin by running "/student/csc209/present".
This records your attendance and is required for you to get the marks for the
lab.

<p>
<hr>

<p>
Today's tutorial is about writing "man pages".

<p>
First, consider the device file /dev/urandom.
You can read about it via "man urandom", but basically, it is a source of
random numbers.
You won't want to <cite>cat</cite> it, because it's an endless stream, and
because it's all binary -- each byte is a random value between 0 and 255
inclusive.

<p>
It's easy to work with from a C program, but not so easy to do so from shell
commands.  So I wrote a little program named "firstbyte" which outputs the
first byte of a file, and as a decimal number.
You can find it in /student/csc209/tut/03/firstbyte.c
<br>
It takes an optional
command-line argument which is a file name to read instead of standard input.
Without any command-line arguments it reads its standard input.

<p>
But you aren't expected to be able to read that C code yet.
Instead, you can simply run the compiled version, which you can find in
/student/csc209/tut/03/firstbyte

<p>
First, play with the program a little and make sure you know what it does and
how to use it.
Here are a few sample commands to try (try the first two a few times in a row
(using the up-arrow key to get a previous command back) because they will
produce different numbers each time!):
<pre>
	/student/csc209/tut/03/firstbyte /dev/urandom
	/student/csc209/tut/03/firstbyte &lt;/dev/urandom
	echo hello | /student/csc209/tut/03/firstbyte
</pre>
Continue to experiment for a minute or two.
It's straightforward, but make sure you know it thoroughly,
with filename arguments, and with stdin.  Note that interactive use of stdin
looks rather strange; so instead try it more along the lines of the above
commands, with a file redirected as
stdin, or with its input coming from a pipe.

<p>
Second, please skim the detailed document "How to write a manual page" which
you can find in
<a
href="../../manpage.pdf">https://cs.utm.utoronto.ca/~ajr/209/manpage.pdf</a>
as a PDF file.
Focus primarily on the beginning of the document; get an idea of the document
and become able to find things in it which you will need in writing your man
page.

<p>
Third, read my additional notes on man-page writing, all of which I think are
relevant to the current exercise, at
<a href="../../manpage-ajr.html">https://cs.utm.utoronto.ca/~ajr/209/manpage-ajr.html</a>
<br>
Regarding the second "bullet point", in particular note that you will
<i>not</i> be documenting things like how if you use firstbyte interactively
in the shell and type more than one byte, the rest of the input is a shell
command -- this is just about how stdin works and is not a
<cite>firstbyte</cite> topic.  Just say that it only reads one byte.

<p>
Finally, write a man page for the "firstbyte" program.
Call your file "firstbyte.1" -- that indicates that this is a man page for
volume one of "The Unix Programmer's Manual".

<p>
This man page will be graded in detail; unlike some labs this term you can't
expect to get 100% just for handing in something reasonable.
Pay attention to detail, brevity, and clarity.

<p>
Useful command to format the man page and display it on the screen just like
how the 'man' command does for installed man pages:
<pre>
	nroff -man firstbyte.1 | less
</pre>


<p>
<hr>
<p>

<h2> To submit </h2>

<p>
First of all, you must run "/student/csc209/present",
during the tutorial time, on the console of a tutorial lab workstation.

<p>
Then, by midnight at the end of your tutorial day,
submit your man page firstbyte.1.

<p>
Submit with the command
<pre>
        /student/csc209/submit tut3 firstbyte.1
</pre>

and the other 'submit' commands are as before (see the end of
<a href="../01/index.html">tutorial one</a>).
