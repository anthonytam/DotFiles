<h4>Answer:</h4>

The program will go into an infinite loop by
recursively opening "." in a directory and thus re-reading the directory
again, and so on forever.
If it ignored only ".", it would go into an infinite loop through opening
".." and reading a parent directory which includes this directory as a
subdirectory and eventually reading this directory again and repeating
indefinitely.
