<h2>CSC 209 tutorials</h2>

Tutorials in CSC 209 are held in
DH 2020,
where there are enough workstations
for all of the students in the tutorial.
During the tutorial you will do exercises as listed below.
In most weeks there is some component of the tutorial which is graded.
In most cases the exercises are intended to be able to be completed during
the tutorial time; however, the submission deadline is actually midnight
at the end of the day your tutorial section is held.

<p>
To get credit for the tutorial exercise you must have attended the
tutorial and had your attendance taken.
To have your attendance taken, run
"/student/csc209/present"
from the shell on a workstation in
DH 2020,
during the tutorial.
If there are any
difficulties with this, please e-mail ajr as soon as possible.
