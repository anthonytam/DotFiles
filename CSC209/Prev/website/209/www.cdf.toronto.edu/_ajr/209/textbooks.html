<h1>Textbooks</h1>

Here are some textbooks you may wish to use for reference during this course.
You may or may not want to buy one or two of them.
Most of the older ones are in the U of T library system.

<dl>

<dt>
The official C textbook for the course:
<dd>
K.N. King, <cite>C Programming: A Modern Approach</cite>, W.W. Norton, 1996
(first edition) or 2008 (second edition).
<blockquote>
Many people like this book.
It seems to be at just the right level for a second-year introduction to the C
programming language.
I've spent a lot of time with the first edition of the book and have not
noticed any technical errors,
<!-- I have not noticed any technical errors in the book, -->
which I think makes it unique for a book about C not written by a unix or
C insider.
</blockquote>

<dt>
The official unix textbook for the course:
<dd>
K. Haviland, D. Gray, and B. Salama,
<cite>Unix System Programming</cite>,
second edition, Pearson Ed. / Addison-Wesley, 1998.
<blockquote>
I think that this is my preferred book for the system-programming part of
CSC 209.
It's got most of what we're covering in that regard and it seems to be clear,
and as far as I can recall I think I've only noticed one substantial
error in it so far.
<br>
(It is listed
as a "required" textbook for the course; however, I will not
be citing page numbers from it in assignments or anything like that, and you
will be able to write the test and exam without it, if you have otherwise
learned the course material.)
</blockquote>

<dt>
Another C book (the canonical C reference):
<dd>
Kernighan &amp; Ritchie,
<cite>The C Programming Language</cite>, second edition, Prentice-Hall, 1988.
<blockquote>
This book is definitely not gentle or fluffy.
But it still has an introductory or tutorial structure.
It is targetted at people with a good understanding of computer programming
in general, but no knowledge of C or unix.
<p>
(The second edition covers material added to the C programming language in
the 1989 ANSI C standard (also published as ISO C 1990), but not material
added to the C programming language in the more recent 1999 ISO C standard.
This might not matter to you at all; at least I think it doesn't matter very
much or very immediately.
However,
the first edition doesn't include the 1989 ANSI C revisions, some of which
were substantial.  I don't think you'll want to use the first edition.)
</blockquote>

<dt>
Classic tutorial introduction to unix and software tools
(somewhat dated, but not too badly):
<dd>
Kernighan &amp; Pike, <cite>The UNIX Programming Environment</cite>, Prentice-Hall, 1984.
<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<dt>
Some general and very wise comments about computer programming:
<dd>
Kernighan &amp; Pike, <cite>The Practice of Programming</cite>, Addison-Wesley, 1999.
<blockquote>
This book focuses primarily on programming in C, but also has assorted
examples from Java and other programming languages where those languages
can illustrate particular points better.
The book discusses software tools.
It's not entirely 209-relevant but it's a <i>very</i> good addition to yer bookshelf.
<p>
Chapter 1 on "style" issues is quite relevant to this course.  It also
includes some material on commenting you might find useful.
<p>
In some ways this book resembles an update of 
Kernighan and Plaugher's
<cite>The Elements of Programming Style</cite>.
(which I think
is an amazing book, but is unfortunately completely inaccessible to most modern
programmers because it is so heavy on the details of some very old programming
languages).
</blockquote>

<dt>
A totally amazing, although also somewhat dated, book about unix and C:
<dd>
S.R. Bourne, <cite>The Unix System</cite>, Addison-Wesley, 1983.
<blockquote>
This book has chapters about shell programming, unix system programming, the C
programming language, troff/nroff, and the data-processing unix tools
(sort/join/comm/uniq/etc).
Amazingly, he somehow manages to cover almost all you need to know as an
introduction to each of these topics.
It is not written as a textbook, 
and you will find it rather intense (obviously, given the scope of its
coverage).
Yes, this is the "Bourne" as in "the Bourne shell".
</blockquote>

<dt>
Classic "advanced" unix system programming book:
<dd>
Richard Stevens,
<cite>Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment</cite>,
Addison-Wesley, 1992.
<blockquote>
In-depth information on a variety of unix system programming topics.
The most-cited reference for tricky TCP / socket programming matters.
Well beyond the scope of this course, but I think it's still worth a mention
in this textbook list.
If in the future you're looking for a more in-depth book about various unix
system programming topics, you should consider the Stevens book.
</blockquote>

<dt>
Another common textbook for this course:
<dd>
Robbins and Robbins, <cite>Practical Unix Programming</cite>, Prentice-Hall.
<blockquote>
This book does have some redeeming features, but when we used this as a 209
textbook we knew we were still looking.
Contains more examples than Haviland et al (which is why I list it here);
contains more errors than Haviland et al.
</blockquote>

<dt>
A really neat book:
<dd>
Yale N. Patt and Sanjay J. Patel.
<cite>Introduction to Computing Systems: From Bits and Gates to C and
Beyond</cite>, second edition,
McGraw-Hill, 2003 (or first edition, 2001).
<blockquote>
We're getting farther away from CSC 209 matters here, but
this is a really neat book which attempts to teach a large swath of a basic
first- and second-year
curriculum, entirely from the bottom up.
Thus it starts with CSC 258ish material, and then uses the computer which is
developed in the first bit to show how the C programming language could be
implemented, and teaches C, and some first-year programming concepts such as
recursion.
<p>
This is not a very 209-relevant book, but actually it doesn't fit any
course in our curriculum because it's based on a rather different curriculum structure
(and the book's use at the authors' university involved a
curriculum restructuring).
You might find this book particularly helpful in understanding
an OS-implementation lecture near the end dealing with interrupts, but that's
just a tiny note in CSC 209.
You also
might find this book interesting in
its discussion of how C relates to the low-level machine, to the extent that
this isn't obvious after completing CSC 258 plus doing C in CSC 209.
