"cat $x" reparses the contents of the variable 'x', so for example if its
value contains spaces, they will be passed as separate arguments to 'cat'.

"cat '$x'" will pass the actual string "$x" to cat, so it will attempt to cat
a file by this name.

"cat "$x"" will do what you probably actually want: it will not reparse the
contents of the variable 'x', so even if the contents of that variable
contains various funny characters (most notably spaces), you will still cat
the file whose name is the contents of the variable 'x'.
