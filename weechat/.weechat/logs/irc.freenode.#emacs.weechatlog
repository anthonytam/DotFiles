I've got some working bash script that copies myfile.wav from host to local, convert it to myfile.mp3 and then sends myfile.mp3 to another server. What I'd like is to make emacs do the job, i.e. ask me for the filename and then launch myscript for that file. To start, I've tried (defun ff (arg) "" (interactive (list (read-string "Enter your filename:"))) ((async-shell-command "cp
2017-02-15 16:46:03	pseudomyne	/mnt/mao/ma_musique/\\arg\.wav"))) and get some syntax error. What's the proper way to insert 'arg' in that piece of code ? Thanks

2017-02-18 15:21:29	tali713	joshuaBPMan_: now, `ediff-load-hook' is documented to execute when ediff is /loaded/.  so, what your hook /should/ do, is when you start a new emacs, the first time ediff is loaded you will globally turn off scroll bars.
2017-02-18 15:22:25	tali713	joshuaBPMan_: if it does this, then it is functioning as defined.  if this is not what you want then you are using the wrong hook, and for that matter, you are probably trying to do something that can't be trivially done.
2017-02-18 15:23:33	joshuaBPMan_	tali713: Ok.  That makes sense.  There are other hooks that ediff uses that deal with window/frame management.  I'll try using one of those.
2017-02-18 15:23:34	tali713	joshuaBPMan_: surely what you meant to write was "whenever ediff is enabled" not "when the library ediff is first loaded into memory", e.g. `ediff-mode-hook' not `ediff-load-hook'

2017-02-18 15:33:19	tali713	joshuaBPMan_: load-hook is wrong, what you are doing won't work anyways.  either you have scroll bars or you don't, it's not buffer-specific.
2017-02-18 15:33:25	paroneayea	I mean, looks ok, but put enough of those together and you got a whole lot of extra ========
2017-02-18 15:36:03	tali713	paroneayea: irc modes do this thing.
2017-02-18 15:36:42	paroneayea	tali713: yeah, I guess the thing is they tend to have just one line per post

2017-02-18 20:09:38	bpalmer	the load-path determines where load looks to find files; it is not a list of things that are actually loaded. There is a separate thing called "autoloads" which may not be set up correctly for you.
2017-02-18 20:10:08	bpalmer	An alternative issue you may be running into is that the function you're trying to use with M-x <function> is not a command; not all functions can be used with M-x

2017-02-20 00:29:20	parjanya	codingquark: but it does shape our perception... for instance, in Portuguese we say we did something ourselves even if we made someone else do it, so we say "I’ve cut my hair" when in English one would say "I had my hair cut"... so at least in some cases the agency depends more on the first cause, the "I" there, than the efficient cause, the one who actually did the job
2017-02-20 00:30:39	codingquark	tali713: better for communication.

2017-02-20 00:31:23	parjanya	codingquark: well, one can say a language is better to speak of something when that field has a culture for it, with words clearly defined for specific meanings. imagine talking about chemistry in a language whose culture never developed it... so it can be better in that sense, but in principle any human language can express anything conceivable
2017-02-20 00:31:26	codingquark	tali713: to ourselves while thinking, and while talking to others.
2017-02-20 00:31:34	tali713	codingquark: about what, and to whom?

2017-02-20 01:02:43	codingquark	Chemistry surely uses fluero.
2017-02-20 01:02:52	tali713	parjanya: but common english in some /spoken/ dialects, have grown conjugations, like "coulda" it may have /been/ a contraction, but it has moved past that.
2017-02-20 01:03:02	parjanya	perhaps it has to do that in olden times people lived in small communities without much pressure to homogenize with other communities, but since we started writing stuff the pressure has just increased
2017-02-20 01:03:22	parjanya	tali713: there are exceptions, and no language is absolutely of either type... you are right
2017-02-20 01:03:36	tali713	parjanya: selection bias.  there are still many local dialects of english, they just aren't brodcast or formal english.
2017-02-20 01:04:08	codingquark	parjanya: pressure to separate everything? I would imagine it would be equally easy if there was a standard way to combine words...
2017-02-20 01:04:10	parjanya	hah, well in English there is also the Norman Conquest to complicate things
2017-02-20 01:04:14	tali713	parjanya: nah, I think you are mostly right, it's just that some dialects of english or more like local languages.
2017-02-20 01:04:21	parjanya	Old English was much more synthetic than Middle English
2017-02-20 01:04:35	tali713	parjanya: yeah, but that's apples and oranges.
2017-02-20 01:04:59	tali713	middle english is the ancestor of modern english, not old english.  we don't even use old english grammar.

2017-02-20 01:07:14	tali713	trust the grammar.
2017-02-20 01:07:54	tali713	old english certainly contributed words, but not grammar.  that suggests strongly that it is /not/ the ancestor but a contributor.
2017-02-20 01:07:56	parjanya	as far as I know that only affected the Northern dialects, but I’m no Germanist
2017-02-20 01:08:59	parjanya	in Old English there was that "breaking" phenomenon, where long vowels became two for some reason, so "break" is brēcan in OE or something, and *in old english* it became breacan
2017-02-20 01:09:15	parjanya	that’s so pervasive in English I really doubt it’s just loanwords
2017-02-20 01:09:21	tali713	parjanya: you can split an infinitive in northern germanic languages including middle and modern english.  not in german or old english, the closest relative of modern english is frisian, not german.
2017-02-20 01:09:39	tali713	which is in the /northern/ germanic dialects, not the southern ones.

2017-02-20 01:10:58	tali713	parjanya: what I am saying is a matter of opinion, but it is an opinion based on grammar, and words, old english and middle english both share the name english, but are not the same language.
2017-02-20 01:11:29	parjanya	well, surely something quite traumatic happened to make them very distinct, I don’t dispute that

2017-02-21 19:32:20	twb	cups-filters/README-    "nofitplot" "filplot=Off", "nofit-to-page", or "fit-to-page=Off".
2017-02-21 19:32:30	sindriava	technomancy: But what you said would probably fix it well enough too
2017-02-21 19:32:51	technomancy	sindriava: right; specifically in the context of emacs is what I'm thinking of

2017-02-21 19:33:33	sindriava	technomancy: Yeah, Emacs could hook into all sorts of graphics APIs that macOS offers, but that's hardly compatible with other platforms
2017-02-21 19:33:50	sindriava	technomancy: There was something about Qt and WebKit in emacs IIRC?
2017-02-21 19:35:11	sindriava	I'll try to make some screenshots

2017-02-21 19:36:38	twb	aidalgol: oh so like you are putting a PNG on a USB key, then physically plugging the USB key into the printer and printing from the onboard display?
2017-02-21 19:36:59	twb	sindriava: you can XEMBED both webkit and emacs windows in a parent window though :P
2017-02-21 19:37:17	technomancy	I think webkit in emacs is one of those "careful what you wish for" things
2017-02-21 19:37:25	aidalgol	twb: no, like I am putting the PS'd PNG on a USB stick and plugging that into a shitty Windows PC that has the colour printer.

2017-02-21 19:42:49	sindriava	for me, it seems to be image display in general

2017-02-21 22:04:15	mloy	Hi, I have a CSV with a list of addresses loaded into an emacs buffer and I want to trim it to just Cityname, SA (state abbreviation). I figured using highlight-regexp then C-x w b or such to paste just the matches, but I don't think emacs likes the way I'm structuring my regexp (which works elsewhere): `([A-Z])\w+, ([A-Z]{2})` So my question is, what am I doing wrong with that regexp? Alternatively, is there 
2017-02-21 22:04:21	mloy	a better way to extract the City, state values?
2017-02-21 22:04:40	mloy	^ from within emacs*

2017-02-21 23:47:44	bpalmer	fnmurillo: presumably wilornel would either be prompted to resolve the conflicts; and killing the resolver will break the pipeline

2017-02-21 23:55:08	mloy	right, he's asking about syncing git commits
2017-02-21 23:55:46	mloy	a login script on the device that runs git pull from the directory could be a simple solution
2017-02-21 23:56:28	bpalmer	a function that does (shell-command "cd foo && git pull"), placed in an idle-timer, would work
