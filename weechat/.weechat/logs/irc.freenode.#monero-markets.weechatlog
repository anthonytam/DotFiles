2017-03-03 22:51:05	_Slack	<awfulcrawler> I'll check the reddits though

2017-03-03 23:02:23	pero	on top of all the fudding of the project - that there was a bug in ringct
2017-03-03 23:03:26	eyejay_2	blazin?
2017-03-03 23:03:34	pero	yes
2017-03-03 23:04:34	eyejay_2	just marginalize him socially whenever he states some BS again

2017-03-03 23:07:10	pero	people like eamonnw are here under the assumption that community members/ops have done, at a minimum, a reasonable amount of effort to protect them

2017-03-03 23:08:15	pero	maybe years - i dont know
2017-03-03 23:10:11	pero	and its not censoring eyejay_2, it's moderation
2017-03-03 23:11:46	unknownids	id say ignore him but you cant ignore slack users
2017-03-03 23:12:09	unknownids	but at the same time i run a subreddit of 30k people and can show you the mod log of banning the same guy 30+ times
