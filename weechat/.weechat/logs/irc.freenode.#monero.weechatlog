2017-03-05 16:17:12	thrmo	the plan is to finish it with Mumuks[m] which is doing the catalan and castillian translation so that we can get something coherent between similar languages
2017-03-05 16:17:28	Mumuks[m]	can confirm
2017-03-05 16:17:35	Mumuks[m]	thats the plan

2017-03-05 16:31:52	Snipa	You're welcome.
2017-03-05 16:32:04	Snipa	It's auctually a collections of about 11 of them.
2017-03-05 16:32:20	knaccc	load balanced?
2017-03-05 16:32:26	Snipa	Geo-DNS'ed.
2017-03-05 16:32:30	knaccc	round robin dns'd?
2017-03-05 16:32:33	knaccc	ah nice
2017-03-05 16:32:35	Snipa	Nah.  Geo'ed
2017-03-05 16:32:35	knaccc	very nice
2017-03-05 16:32:43	Snipa	It's powered by the same GeoDNS as mine.xmrpool.net
2017-03-05 16:32:52	Snipa	Though I didn't add WDC or frankfurt yet.
2017-03-05 16:32:56	knaccc	so very cool.
2017-03-05 16:33:09	Snipa	I'm waiting for the next pt release to update and upgrade all the daemons then add WDC and frankfurt to the open nodes list.

2017-03-05 16:33:29	Snipa	Washington DC.
2017-03-05 16:33:31	Jaquee	cool. is moneroworld.com also using geodns?
2017-03-05 16:33:35	Jaquee	gingeropolous?
2017-03-05 16:33:36	moneromooo	Ah, that works.
2017-03-05 16:33:41	Snipa	Not that I'm aware of.
2017-03-05 16:33:48	Jaquee	ok
2017-03-05 16:33:58	Snipa	My node collection is all servers I run, so I can guarentee all of their states at any given time.
2017-03-05 16:34:04	moneromooo	The idea is making me a wee bit uneasy tbh.
2017-03-05 16:34:04	Jaquee	ah. cool
2017-03-05 16:34:16	Snipa	Which one moneromooo?
2017-03-05 16:34:19	Jaquee	have you done any perfomance test?
2017-03-05 16:34:21	Jaquee	s
2017-03-05 16:34:25	archLinuxUser	w104tcl: What distro did you compile on and what's the error?
2017-03-05 16:34:35	Jaquee	like. how many wallets can each node handle?
2017-03-05 16:34:40	Snipa	Nope.  :)
2017-03-05 16:34:42	moneromooo	That you can do geo dns. Assuming it is what I think it is.
2017-03-05 16:34:49	Jaquee	would be interesting to know =)
2017-03-05 16:35:05	Snipa	Geodns is done via the standard MaxMind libs moneromoo.
2017-03-05 16:35:28	Snipa	I don't personally do it, I outsourced that to a DNS company because I didn't feel like setting up a full DNS infrastructure from the groundup.
2017-03-05 16:35:39	moneromooo	The registrar for... .one  I guess. Then... this registrar sends different entries depending on what other server asks ?

2017-03-05 16:35:51	gingeropolous	knaccc, node.moneroworld is random peoples nodes, node.xmrbackb.one is snipas collection
2017-03-05 16:35:58	Snipa	...  I'm going to ask a silly question, how much do you know about DNS?
2017-03-05 16:35:59	Snipa	:P
2017-03-05 16:36:18	knaccc	gingeropolous i'm using node.xmrbackb.one
2017-03-05 16:36:39	gingeropolous	yeah, thats prolly more reliable :)
2017-03-05 16:36:56	moneromooo	Not much. The basics. Some of it might well be obsolete. A registrar per top level domain. And I think I'm kinda mixing the theory of DNS with NTP anyway :/
2017-03-05 16:37:03	Snipa	Yeah.  Close.
2017-03-05 16:37:21	moneromooo	But AFAIK the resolving goes up a tree, with caches.
2017-03-05 16:37:24	Jaquee	snipa, you have any active testnet nodes?
2017-03-05 16:37:31	Jaquee	public
2017-03-05 16:37:31	Snipa	Jaquee - All of node.xmr does.
2017-03-05 16:37:38	Snipa	I run full public and testnet on all nodes.
2017-03-05 16:37:43	Jaquee	ah. cool
2017-03-05 16:37:48	Jaquee	so i could just use 28081?
2017-03-05 16:37:50	Snipa	Yes.
2017-03-05 16:37:52	moneromooo	But I guess this lets the top level domain registrar replt different things based on who asks.
2017-03-05 16:37:56	Jaquee	cool. i'll try it
2017-03-05 16:38:25	Snipa	moneromooo - Not quite. The top-level (Verisign/whoever) sends it to my DNS provider (DNSMadeEasy), who does a geo-ip on the source IP, then pops a response back based on what the closest server is.
2017-03-05 16:39:24	moneromooo	That "source IP" would not be the client trying to connect though, but the DNS server that client would ask for your server's IP, and possibly with another level, right ?
2017-03-05 16:39:39	moneromooo	Unless they're setup to ask direct to the top I suppose.
2017-03-05 16:40:05	Snipa	Depends on your exact config.  Most people use their ISP's NS's, which tend to be localized to their area.
2017-03-05 16:40:26	Snipa	And DNS also sends the client IP IIRC, for that exact reason.
2017-03-05 16:40:29	moneromooo	OK, I can see how that'd work that way then.
2017-03-05 16:40:45	moneromooo	I... had no idea about this. ffs fucking fuckers...
2017-03-05 16:40:57	Snipa	Been awhile from the last time I did it.
2017-03-05 16:41:09	 *	moneromooo happy about using tor again
2017-03-05 16:41:12	Snipa	But I can dig @ google's servs from around the work, which is a unicast IP, and it always returns the correct geo-loc.
2017-03-05 16:41:19	Snipa	s/work/world/
2017-03-05 16:42:12	moneromooo	s/ffs fucking fuckers.../if only we'd known about humanity before doing it/
2017-03-05 16:42:36	Snipa	Hahaha.
2017-03-05 16:42:46	moneromooo	Anyway, thanks for the overview. It's helpful :)
2017-03-05 16:43:01	Snipa	Of course. :)  I spent years working websites/stacks, so I'm really used to DNS fuckery.

2017-03-05 18:15:38	moneromooo	Trying to use a tipbot, but it's been offline for a while now.
2017-03-05 18:17:45	amiuhle	ah, :) thx
2017-03-05 18:18:20	amiuhle	kind of curious about the workflow of a tipbot, too
2017-03-05 18:19:10	moneromooo	It's not much really. It listens to IRC. It listens to the chain. It waits most of the time.
2017-03-05 18:19:29	moneromooo	And it listens to reddit and twitter if it really has to.
2017-03-05 18:19:50	Jaquee	why is it offline?
2017-03-05 18:19:59	moneromooo	It's on githunb.com/tippero/tippero if you're curious.
2017-03-05 18:20:27	moneromooo	Jaquee: the host machine went down AFAIK. pony needs to do some work on it to bring it back up IIRC.

2017-03-05 22:57:44	throughnothing	prusnak's is probably better to fork, if you care about preserving the correct history
2017-03-05 22:57:52	throughnothing	i just forked that one
2017-03-05 22:58:01	pero	prusnak's?
2017-03-05 22:58:01	throughnothing	unfortunately, no build instructions for that
2017-03-05 22:58:05	throughnothing	yeah
2017-03-05 22:58:28	pero	interestingly i remember pointing  someone else to my fork and they never pointed this out =/
2017-03-05 22:58:34	throughnothing	oh i see, the xmr_trezor repo requires trezor-xmr as a submodule
2017-03-05 22:59:00	throughnothing	it looks like the build tools/scripts are in the xmr_trezor repo, and it points to the trezor-xmr repo
2017-03-05 22:59:08	throughnothing	makes sense, since it creates its own simplewallet
2017-03-05 22:59:12	pero	sounds...confusing
2017-03-05 22:59:16	throughnothing	starting to maybe piece this together
